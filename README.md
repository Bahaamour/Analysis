# Educational level of attainment in relation to household income

Our team chose to take a look at the ten states that were ranked both the highest and the lowest for educational attainment based on findings documented in 2008-2018. The ten states with the highest attainment were Colorado, Washington, D.C, Maryland, Connecticut, Massachusetts. The states with the lowest attainment were West Virginia, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Louisiana. 

For all of the states, we chose to break our analysis into several categories:

* Correlation between the average median income and the average mortgage per capita (Baha)

* Correlation between educational level, median income, unemployment, and theft crimes (Akaron)

* Credit card debt per capita vs Median household income (Marvin)

* Correlation between the median household income and unemployment rate (Vishal)

* Correlation between the average income level vs the average used car price per state (Bethel)


The results of each of the above categories analysis are listed below with accompanying screen shots.
