# Educational level of attainment in relation to household income

Our team chose to take a look at the ten states that were ranked both the highest and the lowest for educational attainment based on findings documented in 2008-2018. The ten states with the highest attainment were Colorado, Washington, D.C, Maryland, Connecticut, Massachusetts. The states with the lowest attainment were West Virginia, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Louisiana. 

For all of the states, we chose to break our analysis into several categories:

* Correlation between the average median income and the average mortgage per capita (Baha)

* Correlation between educational level, median income, unemployment, and theft crimes (Akaron)

* Credit card debt per capita vs Median household income (Marvin)

* Correlation between the median household income and unemployment rate (Vishal)

* Correlation between the average income level vs the average used car price per state (Bethel)


The results of each of the above categories analysis are listed below with accompanying screen shots. 

## Correlation between the average median incone and the average mortgage per capita

The correlation coefficient between "Average Median Income" and "Average Mortgage" is 0.953279, which is very close to 1. This means that there is a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables. As the average median income increases, the average mortgage also increases.

A correlation coefficient of 0.72823 between Median HouseHold Income 2008 and Percentage indicates a strong positive correlation. A positive correlation means that as the values of Percentage increase, the values of Median HouseHold Income 2008 also increase. The magnitude of the correlation coefficient provides information on the strength of the relationship. A correlation coefficient of 0.72823 is considered strong, but not perfect.

## Correlation between educational level, median income, unemployment, and theft crimes

The hypothesis that was started before analysis was done was that states with a lower educational have a higher incidence of theft crimes in correlation to their unemployment numbers.

The conclusion was that higher educational attained states have relatively high incidents of theft in relation to their unemployment numbers. Most of the lower educated states did not, although some did.
